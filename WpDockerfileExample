# Allways use specific FROM tag, DON'T use 'latest'
FROM wordpress:5.2.2-php7.2-apache



## WP Engine:
## If your repository contains the entire engine together with the contents, plugins and themes, make sure to add a Dockerfile with the following content along wp-admin, wp-content, and wp-includes directories

# COPY . /var/www/html

## WP Theme
## If your repository contains only the sources of the theme that you deploy, add a Dockerfile with the following content to the directory with your theme’s sources

# COPY . /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/mytheme/

## WP Plug-in
## If your repository contains only the sources of the plug-ins that you deploy, add a Dockerfile with the following content to the directory with your plug-in’s sources

#COPY . /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/myplugin/


## WP Plug-in AND Theme

## If your repository contains plug-ins and themes, but lacks the WP Engine, you must use the Dockerfile to upload them to the proper location.

## For instance, let’s assume that your repository contains 4 directories: mytheme1, mytheme2, myplugin1 and myplugin2. In this case, you have to add the Dockerfile along all these directories with the following content

#COPY mytheme1 /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/mytheme1/
#COPY mytheme2 /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/mytheme2/
#COPY myplugin1 /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/myplugin1/
#COPY myplugin2 /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/myplugin2/*
